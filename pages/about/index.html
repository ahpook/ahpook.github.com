Counting back, I think this is the eighth or ninth iteration of a personal webpage I've put together since the concept 
of a "home page" first entered my consciousness in 1994.  The first one was self-hosted on my 90mhz Pentium running 
BSD-386 2.0, back when every decently-connected workstation had a real public Internet address (mine was 204.94.112.45 
IIRC). I've gone from self-hosted static pages to ill-fated blogging platforms (remember vox.com?) and back to 
self-hosted blog engines; now the pendulum's swung to a nice hybrid of the two: jekyll hosted on github. 

Without exception, all of them have had some navel-gazing autobiographical content and I'm not about to buck the trend 
this time around.  To wit:

* I'm cheerfully partnered and childed with [@rawwwr](https://twitter.com/rawwwr/) and 
  [@lil_gman](https://twitter.com/lil_gman), respectively.
* I recently relocated to Portland Oregon after a 15-year stint in the San Francisco Bay Area
* I'm employed by Puppet Labs as the product owner for our Open-Source Products, notably 
  [Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet) itself.
* In free time I enjoy [cycling and running](http://strava.com/athletes/1225), hiking under guise of geocaching, 
  roasting and consuming coffee, and making [diminishingly less-terrible electronic 
  music](http://soundcloud.com/ahpook).
