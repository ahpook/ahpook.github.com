Triggered by @leftside's tweet:

I read through the linked tweet and got TEH RAGE.

Flagged it with the following:

<blockquote>
This person's * review should not detract from the restaurant's score because, by her own admission, she "didn't 
actually eat there", but downrated it because she went into a place called "brisas del mar" and they... served mexican 
food. THE AUDACITY!

Check, and mate, Korlany.
