I had a funny conversation with G tonight.

He had just bought Scribblenauts on his iPod with the $5.
And I said he needed to plug it in at my desk, when what he wanted was to take it in his room and plug it in there.

"Nope, sorry," I said. "I'm afraid you will be too tempted to pick it up and play with it if it's in your room."

He considered this for a moment.

"Yeah, you're probably right. You know me too well!" he said.

"Well, we're more alike than you realize."

"No two people are exactly clones of each other though!" he protested.

"Not clones, no, but you are more like me than anyone else on this planet. The next closest person is Bjorn. And you are closer than him."

"Oh...." That seemed to satisfy him.
