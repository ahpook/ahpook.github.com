So we moved office and there are enough of us espresso hounds around that we were able to make the case for a legit machine. So I've been getting used to this Synesso paddle group and Mazzer Jolly grinder. The middle position of the paddle is a half-pressure (5 bar) preinfusion, so you hit it with that for about 5 seconds so the puck swells in the portafilter then you go to full pressure. One you get used to a double boiler and outboard pump, lemme tell you, it is damn hard to go back to home machines.
