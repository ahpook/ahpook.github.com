title: CHARLES BRONSON IS HARDER THAN YOU OR ANYONE YOU KNOW.
---

<blockquote>

<p>Later in the day, Bronson is sitting alone again. I don&#8217;t know whether to approach him; he seems absorbed by his own thoughts, but after a time he yields. &#8220;you can talk to me now. I wouldn&#8217;t be sitting here if I didn&#8217;t want to talk. I&#8217;d be somewhere else.&#8221; </p>



<p>I was wondering about that.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had a very bad experience on the plane in from California yesterday. There was a man on the plane, sitting across from me, and they were showing an old Greer Garson movie. He said, Hey, why aren&#8217;t you in that? The picture was made before I even became an actor. I said, Why aren&#8217;t you? I think I made him understand how stupid his question was.&#8221;</p>
