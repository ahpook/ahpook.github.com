<blockquote><p>Zapfino. Now with Berry Defense!</p></blockquote>







<p>Wow, jeffrock really hates Zapfino! He&#8217;s got a <a href="http://jeffrock.com/tagged/zapfino">whole set</a> of font abuse photos featuring it. While I see his point about its &#8220;indulgant [sic], ham-handed, false-sense-of-class styling&#8221; the thing that really dismays me about this particular example is that it doesn&#8217;t use any of the sweet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapfino#Zapfino_Extra">alternate OpenType ligatures</a> that, to me, are the main feature of the font.  Specifically the double-l double-s &#8220;wellness&#8221; and the unconnected &#8216;x&#8217; in Extract get some nice treatment.</p>
