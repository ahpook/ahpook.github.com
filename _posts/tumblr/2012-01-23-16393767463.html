<p>oh man.

of the many horrible things about the vacation experience, a major one was the fact that every fucking night, down at the &#8220;YOU ARE REALLY HAVING A GOOD TIME NOW&#8221; bar, they had a projection screen + PA which played nothing but songs from a Live Aid concert DVD set.</p>



<p>so the order would be somewhat random, but you were guaranteed to hear:

* roy orbison / travelling willburys, 

* rolling stones, 

* tina turner, and of course 

* journey &#8220;dont stop believing&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p>the fucked up thing was, whoever picked this had <em>nailed it</em> to the fourth std-dev in terms of their demographic.</p>



<p>people were <em>rapt</em> night after night</p>



<p>they would actually applaud after particularly stirring performances such as rod stewart &#8220;forever young&#8221; as if they were actually at a Live Aid concert.</p>
