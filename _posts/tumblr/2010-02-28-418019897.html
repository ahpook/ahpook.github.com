Great music too, kind of echoes the exuberant 1/1 thump of Gobbledigook with some nice glitch elements behind the main sounds.  Hopefully this album will be for Sigur Rós what Thom Yorke&#8217;s &#8220;Eraser&#8221; was to the Radiohead albums: a chance to stretch out in some new directions and then bring the best of them back to the band.</p>
