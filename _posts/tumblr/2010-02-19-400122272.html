<p>Spoilers ahead, such as they are. Be ye warned.</p>

<p>My short form review went like <a href="http://twitter.com/ahpook/status/9371209808">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Shutter Island: too far from scorsese&#8217;s best. Not sure he could have packed more overdone psych/horror tropes into 2hr without slaying coeds</blockquote>

<p>So yes I was a bit disappointed in this film especially as I am a huge fan of Scorsese (hell, I even sat through and <i>enjoyed</i> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217505/">Gangs of New York</a>), and I kept looking for little glimmers of his touch in the movie and found far too few. There are a couple of good 360&#160;tête-à-têtes, a few long tracking shots and a spark of crackling dialogue here and there&#8230; but not much else.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to summarise the plot, you&#8217;ve seen the trailer if not the whole flick. I&#8217;ll dive straight in to the main nut of my problem with the movie, as I tweeted: there was nothing new here and without novelty the twists lacked all punch. What psychological thrillers in this vein thrive on is <i>surprise</i>, the *click* as it falls into place and the viewer has to re-examine everything that&#8217;s come before in light of the new revelation &#8212; think about the moment at the end of Usual Suspects when Agent Kujan fits Verbal&#8217;s story together with the scraps of the bulletin board, or whatever point in Memento you figured out what was really going on &#8212; these are the rewards of the genre and Shutter Island denies them to us by revealing it too early and with way too heavy of a hand.  The moment Teddy describes his Laeddis with a scar across his whole face and mis-matched eyes, his monstrosity/otherness is just too far out there to be anything but a construct. The names are anagrams! The extra prisoner is really him! Stop me if you&#8217;ve heard this before&#8230; a dozen or two times.</p>

<p>Aside from the dual-identity theme, Shutter Island&#8217;s horror elements pull from a bag of tricks as old as film itself without any apparent self-awareness. The soundtrack as the agents enter the perimeter was bombastic enough that Jen &#8212; who&#8217;s hard of hearing &#8212; turned to me and said &#8220;That music is a bit much, eh?&#8221; The Cocteau-esque nightmare sequences, the lightning on the scary mansion (Norman Bates much?), the storm in the graveyard (why did they go there, again?) all left me, a certified horror flick wuss, groaning more than shivering.  It all crescendos in Teddy&#8217;s excursion up to Ward C where the clanking chains and dripping water and &#8212; of course the lights go out &#8212; grabbing hands got some legitimate jumps out of the audience.  But even the dead children didn&#8217;t creep me out as much as they felt sad and inevitable.</p>

<p>Which is where I&#8217;ll close, with one fact-check criticism rather than an artistic comment: was his crime really bad enough to get him committed to the worst of the worst max security psycho wards? I suppose Dr Cawley&#8217;s explanation that he&#8217;s trained to violence and immersed in his dissociative identity (and therefore presumably needed to be committed even after the proximate cause of his breakdown was removed) makes a bit of sense, but I left thinking that his crime was actually pretty understandable and not at all commensurate with the punishment awaiting him at the end of the icepick.  Hardly &#8220;life as a monster&#8221; &#8212; so it&#8217;s a false dichotomy that concludes a flawed, ultimately disappointing film.</p>
