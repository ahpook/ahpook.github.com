<p>Because the first one was just &#8220;Wow, I suck&#8221; and then I added a crappy preset drum beat, really more of a click track with accents, and re-recorded the guitars so they were actually kind of in tempo.  Note I mercifully faded it out just past the one minute mark when I ran out of ideas.</p>



<p>But still, the first song I&#8217;ve finished and recorded in probably fifteen years. So there it is.</p>



<p>The previous one &#8212; if you&#8217;re wondering &#8212; was a thing I did with John Marshall where he sang and did one guitar track and I played bass and another Dave-Navarro-esque guitar thing. I ping-ponged them down to two tracks and we did some screechy/spooky noises on the remaining two. The lyrics were something about Satan and John&#8217;s mom.  I am sure I made a mixdown from the Tascam Portastudio 4-track but sadly the tape was lost to the mists of time.</p>



<p>So was John, for that matter.</p>
