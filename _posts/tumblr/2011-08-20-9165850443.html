title: Sad about palm

<p>(Reposted from a FB comment)</p>



<p>Seriously though as a palm fanboi (i had a 128k Pilot!) and 18-month employee (contract, but still), I think this is really sad. they&#8217;ve been ill served by many masters but none worse than HP.</p>



<p>A favorite memory of working there, just after the III was released and selling like mad: 3com had just moved everybody from the Shoreline offices to their megaplex off Hwy 237 and there was a lot of grumbling. It was weird, our building was separated from the main campus by a physical moat with a bridge&#8212; and the ideological chasm was even wider.</p>



<p>As an inspired &#8220;we&#8217;re here, we&#8217;re weird, f u&#8221; move, a few of the testers had gotten together tons of xmas lights and spelled out P A L M in 10 foot letters in the windows of the third-floor lab, facing the rest of 3com campus.</p>
