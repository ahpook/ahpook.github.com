<a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/133899-paying-attention/">Rob Horning on Paying Attention</a><br/><p>I&#8217;m supremely interested these days in scientific and cultural explorations of &#8220;focused attention&#8221;, and I&#8217;ve been meaning to gather more of this kind of article here.  In this piece, Rob is commenting on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/magazine/21FOB-medium-t.html?_r=2">this silly NYT Mag article</a> which mocks attention science as unfounded, nostalgic hand-wringing. Rob always brings a smart po-mo sensibility to his posts and this one is no exception &#8212; distractibility and the swarm of micro-interruptions that intrude on our post-consumer consciousness, he posits, work in the favour of the media/commercial culture because prolonged concentration, to an advertiser, &#8220;registers as lost opportunities to make sales&#8221;.  Worth a read, the whole thread.</p>
