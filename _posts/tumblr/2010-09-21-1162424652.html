ROUTE(8)                  BSD System Manager&#8217;s Manual                 ROUTE(8)



NAME

     route &#8212; manually manipulate the routing tables



DESCRIPTION

     Route is a utility used to manually manipulate the network routing tables.  

It normally is not needed, as a system routing table management daemon such 

as routed(8), should tend to this task.

BUGS

     The first paragraph may have slightly exaggerated routed(8)&#8217;s abilities.
