<p>Worst cx race of my life today at Cross Crusade #1.</p>



<p>Rolled front tubeless in the first hard corner of preride, but I knew it was a new tire (michelin mud2) and had already lost the rear earlier in the week so I was prepared w/ spare wheels.</p>



<p>Put a spare wheel on the front and rolled on the roads around Alpenrose until the course was open again. Made it half a freaking lap and the rear mud2 (with tube!) pinch-flatted. Guess I was spoiled by those Hutch bulldogs, but man these things were killing me. So now I&#8217;m on spare front+rear wheels and it&#8217;s time to line up.</p>



<p>I got a decent start, but it&#8217;s a huge field and I know I am down on fitness + skillz relative to last year so I take it easy, trading position with some guys and moving up when I can. Then, on the washboardy back side, boom, I wash out on the front &#8212; my spare had pinch flatted!  Just past the pit too, so I had nearly a whole lap to run until I could get a neutral wheel.  It&#8217;s still the first lap, mind you, so giving up is not really an option.</p>



<p>So I ran it.</p>



<p>Two miles.</p>



<p>With the goddamn bike on my back and everyone passing me.</p>



<p>Finally got back around and got a new wheel, but my race was essentially over.  I got back up into suffer-vision though, just to get the workout. I paid my money, I&#8217;m gonna get my 45 minutes, right?</p>



<p>Turned out to be 52 minutes in a 45 minute race, <a href="http://obra.org/events/20819/results">DFL</a> except for the 20 guys who did not finish.</p>



<p>Gotta work out these mechanicals. I did 12 races last season and didn&#8217;t have one pit, and here I flatted 3 times in one day. Both the front and rear mud2&#8217;s came loose at the same point, too: at the valve stem, where the rim strip+valve bulged up enough to keep the bead from seating. When they work, they gripped a hell of a lot better than the ground-to-slick bulldog I had been running, but it&#8217;s just NOT OK to drop out that easily.</p>



<p>Ah well, nowhere to go but up, right?</p>
