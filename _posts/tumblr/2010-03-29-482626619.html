title: I won something!
---

<p>Woot, thanks to <a href="http://digitalnimbus.com/">Digital::Nimbus</a> and their soulmate record label <a href="http://n5md.com/">N5MD</a>, I got some free music.  Pietrobot announced a giveaway of the awesomely talented and awesomely named Another Electronic Musician&#8217;s new album <a href="http://n5md.com/discography/171/States-Of-Space">States of Space</a> with the conditions for entry I thought seemed pretty reasonable:</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my entry, Letterman-top-10 style:</p>

<b>Top 10 Reasons I Like AEM (composed while listening to &#8216;Use&#8217;)</b>

<pre>

10. Dub echoes...echoes...echoes

9. Increased alpha wave activity in brain = better Ruby code written by fingertips!

8. Layered and complex without sounding too busy - a tough feat that Jase pulls off with aplomb.

7. Clickclickclick WHIRRR bleep boop boop

6. Gives my headphone drivers a workout, which keeps them fit and happy

5. It's got a beat, but you can't dance to it.

4. AEM keeps the old-school N5MD flavour alive now that Bitcrush has gone 

all shoegaze-y (not that there's anything wrong with that!!)

3. I mentioned the echoes, but did I mention the reverb --- or rather, the

 reeeevvvveeeerrrrbbbb?  So tasty.

2. He gots the low end bass thump to please the booty.

1. Priceless moments of confusion when people ask me what I'm listening to
