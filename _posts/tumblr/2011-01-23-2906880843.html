<p>At the time I tweeted:</p>



<blockquote> Shalala Ramen verdict: Spicy Miso YUM. Shio not so much. Gyoza perfect. 4/5 **** </blockquote>



<p>Ramen tweets are Very Serious business round these parts so I got a lot of responses, which I was too stuffed to respond to. So I&#8217;ll take them all on now that (five days later) my head has cleared.</p>



<blockquote> @aktse:  the spicy very spicy? I usually go for the non-spicy, but your ramen-fu is very strong and I trust it. </blockquote>



<p>It is quite well balanced &#8212; my gold standard here is the tantan-men at Kahoo and this is slightly less fiery than that but still brings a pleasing heat.</p>



<blockquote> @slonie: Hmm&#8230; I had the shio, and (snob) Saw no reason to return. I&#8217;ll go back and try the spicy miso. Maybe. </blockquote>



<p>I got the Shio for gunnar and neither of us liked it.  But the rest of us at the table with the spicy miso powered it down. The cha-shu was not super wonderful (Gold standard: Kakuni at Maru Ichi) but I thought it was pretty tasty.</p>



<blockquote> @skid: the mystery meat fish cake swirl always scares me away. Otherwise looks delicious! </blockquote>



<p>See, I grew up in Honolulu and can easily take down a whole package of Kamaboku straight out of the freezer.  Yum.</p>



<blockquote> @nekoball: My verdict was the opposite on both counts. #reverseworld? #offday? #differenceintaste?  </blockquote>



<h1>dunno.</h1>
