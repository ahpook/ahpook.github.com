<a href="http://www.maddecent.libsyn.com/mdwwr-63-dja-presents-sounds-like-skinny-puppy-gives-me-nightmares">Mad Decent Industrial Mix</a><br/><p>Oh man. I love all the Diplo/Mad Decent podcasts but this one&#8217;s pretty special. Whirlwind 45 minute tour through the late-80s / early-90s industrial/dance hits. Wax Trax in heavy rotation here, with some classic TKK, prime &#8216;Fixed&#8217; era Reznor, and a special Skinny Puppy-into-Skinny Puppy mix towards the end.</p>



<p>Notably missing however: SKATENIGS and Pailhead.</p>
