<p>I knew the heat was headed in to the South Bay and although my legs were still hurting from Wednesday&#8217;s <a href="http://app.strava.com/runs/835497">trail excursion up St Joes</a> I wanted to stretch it out a bit. First a warmup down the trail to Lark Rd at the campbell/LG border then a &#8220;tickler&#8221; up to Daves Ave &#8212; &#8220;tickler&#8221; being Borba&#8217;s phrase for tickling the heart rate up to threshold but not seriously pushing into the red.  After I was thoroughly tickled, I got a little cool down through the Saratoga Real Estate tour. There&#8217;s all of these ridiculous houses through Sobey and towards downtown Saratoga, little mini-Versailles and maxi-Tudors for the elite arriviste. I like this route because it reminds me of the first group rides I did back in 2005 with Jake and Jeff from <a href="http://wheelaway.com/">Wheel Away</a>.</p>



<p>When I got to Saratoga/Hwy 9 I was faced with a decision. I knew I wanted to keep going but didn&#8217;t really feel like hitting the backside of Mt Eden with its short little f-off 18% stretches. The alternative was to keep heading up 9 to Redwood Gulch and descend into Stevens Canyon, so after a little internal debate, that&#8217;s what I did.</p>



<p>More &#8220;tickling&#8221; ensued, with a goal of keeping it steady, just below LT, and not lose intensity partway through. I got a little unexpected jolt of adrenaline as I got buzzed by, first, a blacked-out M3 blasting up the highway and then <em>six</em> motorcycle cops. Not sure what was going on with that, but sometimes the old saw that there&#8217;s never a policeman around when you need one isn&#8217;t true at all. (They&#8217;re all up on Highway 9!) I felt pretty good on the climb and several times I deliberately kicked up the cadence when I felt myself lagging. After a bit I noticed a guy sitting on my wheel so I swung out to say hi. His name was Dwayne, he apologised for his stealth wheelsucking and we had a nice talk about the upcoming weekend, keeping my mind off the fact that I was well past the &#8220;tickle&#8221; point and into the &#8220;sharp stick jabbing me in the ribs&#8221; zone.  But all good,  I made the turnoff and bid adieu to Dwayne and turned down Redwood Gulch into the shade and dropoffs.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m still a little sketched out at high-speed descending, due to post crash trauma, but I have been deliberately pushing my comfort zone and keeping my speed through the corners. Felt good today but it was still quite a relief to get down to the Stevens Canyon flats and head into work.</p>



<p>Sure enough, it got hot as hell later and I was happy I&#8217;d taken the time to get up into the woods. Something about being under that redwood canopy, pushing the cranks around, sweaty and sore, brings me a kind of meditative calm that&#8217;s otherwise damned elusive.</p>
