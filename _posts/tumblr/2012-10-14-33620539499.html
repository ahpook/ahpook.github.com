<p>This was a fantastic race over the Columbia River in Washington. It&#8217;s held at a motocross park (but not on the motocross course) so there are good facilities and fun terrain. Nothing too technical, but some long swoopy descents and gentle dirt climbs, a technical &#8220;N&#8221; in the grass to honor the sponsor, Ninkasi Brewing from Eugene, who were on hand to dispense soothing craft beer after the ride. Sadly, not Tricerahops, perhaps my favorite IIPA on earth, but we made do. I&#8217;m still nervous about my tire situation so I pitted my Niner hardtail mountain bike in a move that turned out to be a damn good one. After a pre-ride lap and one in the race, my rear rim was bottoming out on the bumps so I ditched the CX bike in the pit and grabbed the MTB, which I really appreciated on the descents and in the mud. Probably &#8216;cheating&#8217; but it&#8217;s not like I was any danger to the outcome, I was just riding my ride and trying to gain position on the guys in front. I did end up catching guys who stayed caught, which felt good. The mud was just right &#8212; sticky on the downhill sections and deep peanut butter for part of a climb. Good times, plus my kid and best gal were there to ring the bells and cheer me on. Highly recommended.</p>
