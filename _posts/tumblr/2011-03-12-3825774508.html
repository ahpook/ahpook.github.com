title: Crashed out
---

<p>Road race season got off to a tough, nearly-tragic start this morning in Monterey when I crashed out of the Central Coast Circuit Race in the second lap.</p>



<p>Things started off so well too. Lorri and I had gotten there early, I got a solid warm-up in, and lined up with the other 5s at 8:30 with good positioning. At the whistle, the pack organized itself with big presence from Navy Postgraduate School team, SuperFred Andrew, and a few of us SJBCers. One of our SJBC juniors took two flyers off the front, which I had to admire but had no desire to follow.  I felt good and stayed towards the front, taking turns when I had to but getting good recovery in, while following strong moves by a FORM Fitness rider and a Pen Velo guy. By the third lap, I could see a lot of the riders were tiring. The pack size had dwindled and at one point I was pedaling easily alone off the front. I sat up and called back, &#8220;WTF guys c&#8217;mon!&#8221; They did eventually move up and I downshifted to match pace, then slotted back in to my 5th wheel position.</p>



<p>At the last long roller before the descent, I found myself behind a slow Navy guy&#8217;s wheel (in fact all the burly Navy bros had faded by this point) and saw others start to stream past his left. I couldn&#8217;t wedge in and didn&#8217;t want to lose more position so I moved around his right. This left me on the right side of the road at the top of the climb with a group of about ten riders, probably the furthest back I&#8217;d been the whole race. The descent came fast. Guys to my left started drifting right but I was boxed in and got squeezed off the right edge of the pavement and lost control as I slid out in the gravel. I smacked my shoulder on the road edge and slid a little in the gravel. I unclipped and hollered, first for help then with a string of oscenities both loud and unoriginal, so I won&#8217;t bother transcribing them here.</p>



<p>I lay there hurting for a bit and then the race first aid vehicles arrived. There was a jeep with flashers (maybe a park vehicle?) driven by a man I didn&#8217;t see and a BMW X5 with the primary EMT. She helped me out and got me into the passenger seat, and I commented that she should move her vehicle off the race course. It seemed obvious that we were posing a hazard at the bottom of a steep hill with racers still on the course. I sat there for a couple minutes while they tried to stow my bike, and then the nightmare came to life.</p>



<p>The Cat4 pack came whistling down the hill amid shouts of &#8220;slow! slow!&#8221; Riders started hitting the ground and I heard at least one awful impact as someone smacked into the back of the vehicle I was sitting in. There were guys moaning in pain and trying to untangle themselves from their bikes and fellow riders, in short - carnage. The race EMT ineffectually shouted, &#8220;Call 911!&#8221; to the other people. She seemed completely freaked out. Then the Cat5s came around again and they still hadn&#8217;t neutralized the race. Andrew got bumped into the vehicle I was in as he tried to slow everyone down because there was still a downed rider in the middle of the road. I called out to him and asked him to go find Lorri at the top of the hill and tell her I&#8217;d crashed. A guy who clearly had medical training took charge of the worst-injured rider (also named Eric) and got him back-boarded and loaded into the BMW. Eric sounded bad and there was at least one other severely hurt rider behind me (who was probably Jonathan K-T) plus two guys up the road in front of me who looked shaken and scraped but not dire.  At that point actual paramedics and fire trucks arrived. I sat there shaking from shock as I heard them trying to deal with the critical cases around me. Eventually they got the other riders triaged: a guy with minor injuries and I were loaded into a third ambulance. The rest of the day in ER was just pain and waiting.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so messed up over this. I heard Jon was helicoptered from the site and I just hope that he&#8217;s okay. I can&#8217;t understand why race officials didn&#8217;t neutralize the top of that hill as soon as one of their vehicles was on the actual race course. I can&#8217;t help feeling guilty for being first down and setting this chain of events in motion, even though I kno intellectually I wasn&#8217;t responsible for the.</p>



<p>But most of all I want to heal up and get back out there.</p>
