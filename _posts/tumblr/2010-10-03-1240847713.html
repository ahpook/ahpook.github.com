title: 'PS3: Legendary Failure'
---

<p>It&#8217;s quite stunning how awful the PS3 software really is. Even now, years after launch, basic user interactions are done in so thoughtless and indifferent a manner as to make one wonder what the hell, exactly, they were thinking when they released the stuff.</p>



<p>To take but one example, the one that&#8217;s closest to my heart as it&#8217;s what is giving me time to write this, game updates on the PS3 are (a) mandatory, (b) unable to be put in the background, and (c) misleadingly, unreasonably slow.</p>



<p>Tonight I put in the disc for &#8220;Heavy Rain&#8221; hoping to play a bit before bedtime and it immediately began a 1.1G download with no prompt to begin playing unpatched. I&#8217;m not sure where the content servers are located but it took about 35 minutes on my normally-quite-zippy 10MBit cable internet connection. The only message as it was downloading said &#8220;This download is not able to run in the background.&#8221;  Why, Lord, why?  I wandered off and started to get excited when it got to 95% &#8212; but at 100% it then said &#8220;Installing update&#8230;&#8221; and another 15 minute progress bar began. Then, finally, the game loaded and <em>the first thing it did was go into an, again, non-optional, non-interactive installation!</em>  This was another 10 minutes, so it was a full hour between putting the disc in and the &#8220;Press Start&#8230;&#8221; prompt.  Astounding.</p>



<p>Contrast with Xbox, which permits all downloads to run while you&#8217;re doing other things (plus intelligently manages the queue), gives you the option not to take the update (although quite reasonably disallows online play until you patch), and does not require a separate install step after the download. I&#8217;m no Microsoft fanboy &#8212; hell, I worked there involuntarily and left as soon as I was able &#8212; but respect where it&#8217;s due, the XBox team got nearly everything about user interaction with the console right.</p>



<p>And Sony, for all of their money and resources, their alien Cell processor technology, and their decades in the console business, got it all completely wrong.</p>
