<p>Get it <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Holy+Other/_/TOUCH">here</a> &#8212; free download.</p>



<p>Witch house gets a <a href="http://no-trivia.com/2010/10/salem-and-why-its-never-been-about-authenticity/">lot</a> of slagging, some of it <a href="http://www.aprilfish.net/?p=3060">salient and well constructed</a> but there&#8217;s a lot of <a href="http://lakeradio.bandcamp.com/album/delta">amazing music</a> getting tarred with that harsh brush, and this EP from Holy Other has a lot going for it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Touch&#8221; in particular takes more than a few notes from Burial (by no means a bad thing, how many times can you really listen to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Burial/_/Etched+Headplate">&#8220;Etched Headplate&#8221;</a>, oh yeah <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/ahp00k/library/music/Burial?sortOrder=asc&amp;sortBy=name">A LOT</a>) but does away with the murky layering in favor of crystal clear, spacious reverberations, and a precise build-up of the beat.</p>



<p>Worth the $0 for the track download, the EP&#8217;s worth <a href="http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29875">the buy off bleep.com</a></p>
