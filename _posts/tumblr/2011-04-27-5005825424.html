Blasted down foothill, PR&#8217;ed up the top of Alpine, then hit the dirt to climb to Skyline.  Slonie was rocking it on the dirt, I was feeling wobbly and lame and slowed us down by walking and having to dig dirt out of the stupid Speedplays, not meant for the mud. So pretty though and mostly quite ridable trail conditions. It&#8217;s awesome to just pop out at Page Mill/Skyline, like &#8220;whoa, there we are.&#8221; I had a couple of little &#8220;oh shit&#8221; moments on the Page Mill descent due to post-crash panic, but consciously relaxed and shifted weight back and let it roll. No idea where Lee took us with the Los Altos &#8216;strada bianchi&#8217; pathways but it dumped us at Moody and then it was a straight Tiny Wings style race-the-darkness ride back to HQ to get home&#8230; late and in trouble. Epic&#8217;d, especially for a goddamn Wednesday.</p>
