I like driving the speakers (Paradigm Studio 20s) with the integrated amp I have. It&#8217;s an Audio Van Alstine Omega 3, and true to their philosophy, it is very clean and very well built but completely manual and old-school. No digital in, no switching. You even have to adjust the volume manually. But damn, it sounds good.</p>
