<p>Don&#8217;t know about you all but I&#8217;m kind of over posting on tumblr. The lack of reasonable commenting and the constraints that puts on back-n-forth conversation is really, really annoying. Your choices are &lt;3 or reblog. That&#8217;s it.</p>



<p>I used to post most of my stuff from the phone but testing the iOS betas has screwed up my flow and I just sort of stopped caring. I resurrected my old self-hosted URL  at <a href="http://eric.explosive.net/">http://eric.explosive.net/</a> to mess around with Typo but got stuck importing the backlog of posts from here.  <em>le sigh</em></p>



<p>What about y&#8217;all?</p>
