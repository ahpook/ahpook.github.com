<p>People were asking me about this machine that appeared our building recently as I&#8217;ve (somehow, mysteriously) gotten something of a reputation as an espresso hound.  Despite my general mistrust of these super-automatic machines I felt obligated to try it out. Indeed, as I&#8217;d feared, the output was bad: despite using the &#8220;ristretto&#8221; pod and &#8220;pull&#8221; (meaning button), the shot was watery with weak thin crema. The espresso tasted simple and bland, without much by way of nuance or flavour and had the starbucks-style rubber/tire early taste that indicates old beans that weren&#8217;t treated kindly even when they were fresh. But, to be charitable, it wasn&#8217;t as bad as some of the pods I&#8217;ve tried &#8212; I tried a Nespresso machine which used the taller, thimble-shaped pods in a store last year and could barely choke down its acrid, chemical-tasting output &#8212; and, well, it spit out an espresso in 30 seconds for free.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll stick with my Rancilio, but in a pinch this thing is actually better than the coffee bar espresso.</p>
