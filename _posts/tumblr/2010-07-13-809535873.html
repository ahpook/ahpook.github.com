title: vacation day 2
---

<p>Tahoe Day 2 was about as intense a vacation day as I ever hope to survive. 

<!--more--></p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t quite get out the door at 6AM, but I did gear up and start pedaling by 7:36&#160;<a href="http://www.strava.com/rides/135823">according to Strava</a>. The loop I chose was tricky in places due to the all-pervasive summertime roadwork around here. The initial stretch north on 28 around the lake, the climb out of town on 267&#160;<em>and</em> the return along 89 were all marked by construction dust, washboard-rough shoulders, and hand-waves to beg the indulgence of the drivers as I avoided the &#8220;cone zone&#8221;.</p>



<p>But despite all that, there were plenty of mitigating factors.  The construction couldn&#8217;t completely obscure the lovely scenery as I climbed out of King&#8217;s Beach, and once I hit Brockway Summit&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230; all of a sudden the road turned to fresh asphalt, the traffic thinned out (or, perhaps more appropriately, I started keeping pace with it &#8212; I apparently hit 47 mph at one point) and my Della Santa started singing underneath me.  The flat stretch into Truckee felt great and I even managed to hit a nice rhythm on the ice-cracked pavé-ment of Hwy 89 back towards Lake Tahoe.</p>



<p>So I pushed it back home and made it right at the time I&#8217;d predicted in the note I left for Jen. The house was just waking up and I quickly scrubbed up and got ready for our next activity: geocaching.  Well, first espresso, then geocaching.  First espresso, then wandering about for too long trying to find cache treasures, then geocaching. Well &#8212; in all honesty I suck as a navigator and should not be allowed to vector us in to unknown caches. It looked so promising! A very friendly trailhead and a trail that&#8217;s even marked on google maps, but we&#8217;d approached the cache from the wrong side and it just didn&#8217;t go well for us. We had a tough 90-minute bushwhacking slog that ended up with Jen and Gunnar hanging out in the shade while the dog and I ran back uphill to get the car.</p>



<p>Everyone was a good sport about it though and we regrouped back at the condo, recharged with some lunch, reëxamined the maps, and set out again with firm purpose. This time &#8212; success!  We found the lovely Dollar Reservoir just as the <a href="http://coord.info/GC1E8RY">cache page</a> described. Gunnar got his first actual mostly-un-assisted find, Jen pulled the travel bug she&#8217;d been gunning for, Laswell got to swim in a serene, idyllic pond and I got to (mostly) redeem myself as navigator.</p>

<p>We were so energized after the find that we paused at the condo only long enough to change clothes and head back down to Skylandia Park to hit the beach. Ah, <em>Skylandia</em>! It sounds like the name of the king&#8217;s realm in a second-rate Zelda knockoff. But in reality it&#8217;s a gorgeous state park and public beach where we ran out the remainder of the daylight splashing, exploring, fetching and ogling (respectively, as above).</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s two out of the four:</p>

<p>The daylight thus spent, we headed back in for dinner and decompression. Thus I give you this writeup. Yes, it&#8217;s a colossal disappointment - I completely failed on the &#8220;nap-a-day&#8221; goal, but I intend to make up for it by being asleep by ten PM.  There&#8217;s always tomorrow.</p>
