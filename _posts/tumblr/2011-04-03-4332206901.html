<p>week three after the crash, two point five after surgery.</p>



<p>i had to pull back a little bit last week - i did a road ride <a href="http://app.strava.com/rides/370490">last sunday</a> and although i felt OK at the time, in retrospect it just seemed like a bad idea. i was jittery coming down hicks and shannon, twitching in anticipation of road bumps to baby the hurt clavicle.  it&#8217;s just too soon. so the rest of the week i took it pretty easy. too easy, in fact, so that by thursday i was on the downside of a spiral &#8212; don&#8217;t work out, don&#8217;t have energy to work out, don&#8217;t want to do anything&#8230; ugh. it hits fast. i had to claw my way out of it but i still felt like real cycling just wasn&#8217;t <em>smart</em> given the risk-reward equation. so i <a href="http://app.strava.com/runs/384878">ran instead</a>, a nice mostly-dirt run down the trail with the dogs. that felt good. really good. today i resolved to put in <a href="http://app.strava.com/rides/388298">some time on the trainer</a> which was a good choice.</p>



<p>i&#8217;m going off on vacation at the end of next week, so there&#8217;ll probably be some swimming, hopefully a climb up Tantalus or two, and some chillaxing at the beach.</p>



<p>when i come back, i&#8217;m gonna hit it.</p>



<p>hard.</p>
