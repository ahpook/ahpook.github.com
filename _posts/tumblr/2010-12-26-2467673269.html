<p>Thanks for all the AV feedback.  Despite Tumblr&#8217;s inability to receive or display comments correctly I managed to bounce ideas off people and get some good advice.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I determined I just can&#8217;t justify a full home theater rig. My setup is in kind of a weird in-between state relative to the way AV receivers are marketed: I am just certain that the speakers are better driven by my existing AVA amp than by the Front channel of a 7.1&#160;70-100 watt per channel amp, but HT people have made unamplified pre-outs the domain of the high end, assuming you&#8217;d have separate power amps for each of your 7 (or 9!) surround channels.  Aesthetically, this sort of wiring rats&#8217; nest is just nuts, it&#8217;s not at all what my (or, I&#8217;d argue, <em>anyone&#8217;s</em>) living room needs:</p>

<p>I have zero interest in wiring my living room for more speakers so the feature set on the AV receivers that I&#8217;d actually use is reduced to (a) moving input switching from the TV to the receiver and (b) provide digital audio in for my not-yet-purchased AppleTV.</p>



<p>Which brings me to the real dilemma: the ultimate goal, as I said in yesterday&#8217;s post, is to get easy, headless access to the mp3 library. I had been looking at the aTV as a good way to get that, via AirPlay or the Remote iOS app, which would probably work, but the more I look into it the more limited and locked-down the aTV seems. It&#8217;s kind of sad really; the thing doesn&#8217;t even include a web browser?! The closest way to get there seems to be <a href="http://firecore.com/atvflash-black">this beta version of aTV Flash Black</a> but it&#8217;s ridiculous you have to jailbreak the device then install payware on it to bring up a web browser.  I understand wanting to control the ecosystem and blah blah blah but this box is basically crippled for no good reason.</p>



<p>On the other end of the spectrum are the open media box projects like XBMC, Boxee and Plex. I&#8217;d messed with XBMC a while back and while at one level it&#8217;s amazing that it works at all, it&#8217;s not something I could hand off and expect to work without constant futzing around &#8212; for instance it manages media sources completely separately from iTunes so it won&#8217;t automatically pick up changes in the library. These would run on older appleTVs but not the new one anyway, so it&#8217;s sort of moot. Plex is definitely slick though, thanks to @dsully for pointing me at it.</p>



<p>So what I realized was that I want a <em>real computer</em> with some remote control ability, plugged into my TV, not a home theater PC at all.  To that end:</p>

<p>This guy goes becomes my new desktop. The old Mini, which is already upgraded to 4G memory and a 1TB 7200RPM drive, goes into the living room, and will connect via DVI to the TV, via normal 3.5mm-to-RCA to the amp. Bluetooth KB and Trackpad and we&#8217;re golden for couch surfing.</p>



<p>Yes, I will still have to get off the couch to switch inputs. I think I can live with that.</p>
