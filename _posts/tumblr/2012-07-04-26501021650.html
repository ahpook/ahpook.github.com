<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_m6ncslMZ3G1qb72m3o1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>Started off right with an über-local breakfast &#8212; omelette i made from chris&#8217; ducks egs, spinach, pdx cheddar, along with sweet potatoes aimee dug up from her garden and broiled in balsamic.</p>



<p>Andy and I hit upon doing <a href="http://www.rubbertotheroad.com/?p=205">this ride</a> in SE with a gentlemanly 2PM rollout time. I made my way through the city including a little zip up Mt Tabor, which looks like it&#8217;d be amazing for cyclocross but the permit situation is apparently straight-up impossible. One thing the ride description didn&#8217;t emphasize enough is how much it sucked getting out there; there&#8217;s basically a 10 mi stretch on a two lane highway (the misleadingly-named &#8220;Sunnyside&#8221;) followed by another 15 mi on 1 lane country highway w/ cars buzzing past the whole time (224). The <a href="http://www.rubbertotheroad.com/?p=714">&#8220;variation&#8221;</a> would have been way better; lesson learned. Most drivers are super courteous, but getting buzzed just got old fast.</p>



<p>Andy is a long-distance tourer&#8212; he rode <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land's_End_to_John_o'_Groats">lands end to john o groats</a> for shit&#8217;s sake &#8212; but had been off the bike for a while so his rolling speed was lower than what I&#8217;m used to. Plus, we had to single up and get strung out along the highway and that was a little frustrating too. However, once we started the actual <em>loop</em> it was fine: lovely scenery, good conversation, and some moments of sheer beauty like coming across the solo buffalo in the middle of a tree farm, following the clackamas river over some old-school bridges, and a great canyon ride through Maple Lane on the way into Oregon City.</p>



<p>Along the way, deep into Carver country, we came across a throwback ranch house whose inhabitants had felt it necessary to ring their property-line with american flags and McCain/Palin 2008 signs.  The most interesting one was right at their driveway: it had mccain&#8217;s name blacked out with a thick-tip sharpie, leaving just PALIN 2004 as the message they wanted to deliver.</p>



<p>The slog back up 99 into town was a tough beast: the scenic beauty of a West San Jose expressway with the road conditions of downtown Salinas. I had this definite sense that I wasn&#8217;t in Portland proper any more when I came across a capitalist war in progress between competing chains of DRIVE-THROUGH BIKINI GIRL ESPRESSO STANDS.  Not just an isolated phenomenon, there were multiple chains engaged in classic spam-marketing escalation. Hell, they almost got me to stop, but I had a higher purpose in mind &#8212; getting the hell out of Gladstone &#8212; and, anyway, they were all closed.</p>



<p>Although we&#8217;d split during the Highway to Hell, Andy and I regrouped in Sellwood and had a nice ride back to civilization, with a quick refueling stop at the Hawthorne/SE 12th food cart pod where I straight-up devoured a catfish po&#8217;boy and Andy manfully took down a plate of poutine.</p>



<p>61.7 mi in under 5 hours of wall-clock time, including a couple of nontrivial stops&#8230; pretty well-spent Sunday exploring my new environs, I&#8217;d say.</p>
