<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_ldygc4NCu81qb72m3o1_r1_500.png"/><br/><p>Proposed A/V rig.</p>



<p>I have two goals in mind:</p>



<ol><li> Be able to play mp3s through the stereo without the TV on or a laptop plugged in to a RCA-&gt;3.5mm jack</li>

<li> Have a device that can easily throw up youtube/vimeo/web browser on the TV.</li>

</ol><p>The box in the middle is a <a href="http://us.marantz.com/Products/2926.asp#">Marantz NR1501</a>, which is available at an awesome price because they just introduced the upgraded <a href="http://us.marantz.com/Products/3216.asp">NR1601</a>. This seems like a step down to me actually because (a) there&#8217;s no unamplified out to drive the preamp, and (b) it adds 2 more channels of surround sound I don&#8217;t need. (I don&#8217;t even have 5.1 now so a bump from 7 to 9 channels doesn&#8217;t matter at all to me)  The addition that <em>does</em> seem nice with the 1601 is the native ipod docking (you can navigate ipod with the remote). But with the appleTV that seems like a non-issue.</p>



<p>Open Questions:</p>



<ul><li> Is there a comparable box that has a &#8220;real&#8221; set of line-outs for preamp instead of using the VCR out on the Marantz? The <a href="http://www.crutchfield.com/p_022RXV567/Yamaha-RX-V567.html">Yamaha V567</a> looks like it but information is scant on it. </li>

<li> Is all of this really necessary? Seems like a minimalist but functional option would be a simple audio DAC like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gefen-GTV-DD-2-AA-GefenTV-Digital-Decoder/">this Gefen box</a> for TOSlink audio from the AppleTV and leave everything else as it is. </li>

</ul><p>Augh! AV Angst. What do you all think?</p>
