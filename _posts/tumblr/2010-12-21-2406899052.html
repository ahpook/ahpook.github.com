<p>Micro-review for Access to Arasaka &#8216;Void();&#8217;; also posted to his <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Access+To+Arasaka/+wiki">last.fm entry</a></p>



<p>AtA released the follow-up to ‘Oppidan’ in 2010 on Tympanik Audio. ‘Void();’ took the soundscapes and intricate percussion even further, blending deep ambience, half-heard glitches and skittery percussion with transcendently beautiful melodies that emerge out of the darkness like a ray of light through the gloom of an abandoned subway tunnel. Its sixteen tracks span a variety of moods and textures, from the propulsive ‘Chiastic Slide’-era Autechre churn of “Array[08191]” to deconstructed jungle line that anchors “Syslog_Ident” but thematically, as indicated by song titles pulled from Linux source code and the seamless flow between tracks, the album is best experienced at one go— preferably on good headphones, ideally late at night with the hum and glow of inconceivably powerful computers as your only companion.</p>
