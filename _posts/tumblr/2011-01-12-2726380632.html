<a href="http://www.sweetmarias.com/coffee.central.panama.php">Super-Premium Coffee Hype</a><br/><p>Look at the cupping scores and prices&#8230; is there <em>any possible way</em> that the Esmerelda deserves an eightfold price increase over the Carmen Estate?</p>



<p>I have had a top-grade Esmerelda Gesha before. A friend in the biz slipped about 30 grams to me in a tiny paper bag. It was good. It was <em>damn</em> good. But was it $40-a-pound good? (this is wholesale, mind you&#8212; the retail on the sample I had was nearly double that)  In my opinion, no, it was not. I&#8217;m not sure what a coffee would have to do in order to justify that kind of price in my mind, but it would have to go substantially beyond just &#8220;tasting good&#8221; &#8212; perhaps induce effects similar to those caused by other substances I&#8217;ve been surreptitiously passed in unlabelled bags&#8230;</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s good for the farm that they can command that kind of price at auction, and maybe it&#8217;s good for the specialty coffee industry that they can turn a nice profit at the extreme high end.  But this is hype, and hype, wherever it appears, deserves to be called out as such.</p>



<p>(Note: I&#8217;m not blaming Sweet Marias here; they are simply passing on the price they paid. Tom &amp; Co are completely awesome and fairly earn my bucks for coffee, gear, and the excellent Dogs of Coffee calendar. But not the Gesha.)</p>
