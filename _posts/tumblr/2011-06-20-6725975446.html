title: Top 5 tmux features that have improved my life
---

<p>I switched from screen to tmux a couple weeks ago. Just replied to a post from a fellow switcher on baylisa with the following top 5 list:</p>



<ol><li>multiple cut-and-paste buffers! &#8216;set -g buffer-limit 30&#8217; then &#8216;bind = choose-buffer&#8217; &#8230;bliss</li>

<li>way fewer terminal emulation bugs - screen gave me this awful backwards-stairstep redraw problem when editing a multi-line commandline, tmux works</li>

<li>scrollback/cut-n-paste mode persists until you deliberately exit. in screen, marking the end of a buffer exits scrollback, which is pretty much never what I want.</li>

<li>supports solarized colorscheme with easy config: <a href="https://github.com/seebi/tmux-colors-solarized">https://github.com/seebi/tmux-colors-solarized</a></li>

<li>multi-attach behaviour much nicer with different-sized terminal window clients &#8212; it shows you the gaps in a nice halftone.</li>

</ol>
