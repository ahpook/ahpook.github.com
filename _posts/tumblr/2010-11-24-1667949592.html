<p>I thought Steve Reich was mostly doing conceptual/performance pieces these days but apparently three percussion groups co-commissioned this Mallet Quartet last year. I&#8217;m severely bummed that this group, So Percussion, premiered the piece just down the road at Stanford earlier this year and I didn&#8217;t hear about it until tonight. But at least there&#8217;s this awesome recording. Here&#8217;s a link to <a href="http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Steve-Reich-Mallet-Quartet/49265">Reich&#8217;s composer&#8217;s notes about the piece</a>.</p>
